Fix and improve my uploaded Angular 17 + Tailwind CSS + Angular Material project UI. 

### Issues to Fix
1. **Alignment & Structure**
   - Correct misaligned components (icons, titles, fields, and columns).
   - Ensure consistent spacing between form fields, tables, and cards.
   - Standardize layout for forms, tables, and headers (centered titles, properly aligned icons, equal column widths).

2. **Sizing**
   - Replace oversized cards and text with **normal, readable sizes**.
   - Headings: medium size, bold; Form labels: normal size, slightly bolder; Table text: normal size.
   - Buttons should be medium-sized with subtle gradient fills and proper hover effect.

3. **Color & Contrast**
   - Fix mismatched text and icon colors against background.
   - Use proper contrast for both Light & Dark themes to ensure readability.
   - Gradient headers remain attractive but subtle (no eye strain).

4. **Dark/Light Theme Toggle**
   - Fix the toggle so it switches themes dynamically across all components.
   - Ensure background, text, icons, and table colors switch correctly.
   - Save theme preference locally (optional but preferred).

5. **Padding & Spacing**
   - Fix inconsistent padding and margin across components.
   - Minimum padding: `p-4` for cards, `p-2` for form fields, `p-3` for table rows.
   - Add uniform spacing between sections (e.g., 16â€“20px gap).

6. **Icons & Titles**
   - Ensure icons are consistently sized and aligned with text.
   - Use Material icons or Lucide icons (same set across app).
   - Page titles should have subtle gradient text or underline effect, aligned left.

7. **Global Polish**
   - Maintain modular structure (SCSS or component CSS).
   - Apply consistent typography (e.g., Inter, Roboto, or Tailwind default).
   - Responsive design: works on desktop & tablets without overlapping.

### Instructions
- Do not remove any functionality.
- Only adjust styles, alignment, text sizes, padding, colors, and toggle logic.
- Keep UI clean, professional, and consistent across all pages.
