Enhance my uploaded Angular 17 + Tailwind CSS + Angular Material project to have a professional UI inspired by Metronic.

### UI Guidelines
1. **Metronic-Style Layout**
   - Sidebar navigation with collapsible menu sections.
   - Top navigation bar with user profile, notifications, and theme toggle.
   - Content area with breadcrumb navigation and page title.

2. **Color & Gradient**
   - Use a limited, professional gradient palette (blue, purple, teal, gray).
   - Gradient should be applied subtly to headers, buttons, and highlights.
   - Background: soft light/dark tones matching Metronic's theme.

3. **Typography & Sizing**
   - Font: "Inter" or "Roboto" (consistent across all components).
   - Text sizes:
     - Page Titles: 20px – bold.
     - Section Headers: 16px – semi-bold.
     - Body & Table Text: 14px – regular.
   - Button size: medium with rounded corners (8px radius).
   - Icon size: 20–24px, aligned with text.

4. **Components & Alignment**
   - All forms and tables styled like Metronic cards (slim borders, subtle shadows, rounded edges).
   - Uniform padding (p-4 for sections, p-3 for cards, p-2 for form fields).
   - Consistent spacing between form groups, tables, and sections (16px gap).

5. **Dark/Light Mode**
   - Fully functional toggle for Light and Dark modes.
   - Adjust gradients, text, and icons for proper visibility in both themes.
   - Theme switch should apply globally without misalignment or color conflicts.

6. **Professional UI Features**
   - Use Material or Lucide icons similar to Metronic.
   - Add hover animations for buttons and menu items.
   - Use breadcrumbs under page titles for navigation clarity.
   - Tables: striped rows, sticky headers, subtle hover effects.

### Deliverables
- UI must replicate Metronic structure (sidebar, header, cards, typography).
- Gradient color usage should be minimal but modern.
- Fix all previous issues (alignment, padding, color mismatch, card sizing).
- Keep project modular with reusable styles and theme configuration.
