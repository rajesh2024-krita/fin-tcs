Update my Angular 17 + Tailwind CSS + Angular Material project to enhance the **Society Form** with an approval workflow.

### Requirements
1. **Society Form Fields**
   - name, address, city, phone, fax, email, website, registration no
   - Interest Tab: Divident, OD, CD, Loan, Emergency Loan, LAS
   - Limit Tab: Share, Loan, Emergency Loan
   - Ch Bounce Charge
   - Dropdown: Cheque return charge, Cash, Bonus
   - Actions: Edit, View (existing functionality retained)

2. **Approval Workflow**
   - When a user edits and clicks "Save", changes are stored as **pending**.
   - All other Society users must approve the changes before final save.
   - Display approval status:
     - Total users required for approval.
     - How many users have approved.
     - Remaining approvals pending.

3. **Pending State**
   - If not fully approved, display **"Pending Approval"** badge on Society form.
   - Pending changes should be viewable but not overwrite original details.
   - Only after all users approve, update becomes final.

4. **UI Enhancements**
   - Add an **Approval Status Panel** on the Society form page showing:
     - List of users who need to approve.
     - Approval counts (Approved / Total).
   - Approval button for eligible users with confirmation modal.
   - Use card-based layout for Society details and Approval Status.

5. **Visual Design**
   - Professional UI inspired by Metronic.
   - Gradient header for Society form.
   - Icons for "Pending", "Approved", and "Rejected" states.
   - Subtle animations for approval updates.

6. **Dark/Light Mode Support**
   - Ensure new components adapt to theme toggle.

### Deliverables
- Society form with editable fields, view mode, and approval workflow.
- Approval tracking UI showing pending count, approved count, and list of approvers.
- Pending changes should not overwrite original until fully approved.
- Consistent Metronic-style design, proper alignment, and responsive layout.
